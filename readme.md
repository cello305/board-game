# 3D DICE ROLLER

My goal here is to make a truly satisfying dice roller. One that's the next best thing to rolling real dice. It rolls polyhedrons that actually have numbers on each face that you can see as they roll and bounce around the screen, with sound effects. Supports d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100 plus modifiers.

This app is derived from the work of Anton Natarov (aka Teal) found at http://www.teall.info/2014/01/online-3d-dice-roller.html and uses [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [canon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) for the geometry and physics. It also grabs true random numbers (from atmospheric noise) from random.org.
